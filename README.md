# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is about building Movie Recommendation System , that takes a movie from the user as an input and recommends movies based on content 

We use the concept of similarity score

Similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. 
Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. 
The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), 
chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
